==== MapML

Several participants worked on this MapML track.

mailto:rpcavaco@gmail.com[Rui Cavaco]'s work (in person at code sprint) had three different 'tracks':

* get a more complete understanding of MapML concept, experimenting with reference implementation polyfill's examples;
* experimenting with JavaScript, possibly extending some polyfill's funcionality;
* understand polyfill suport to projected CRS's such as 'national grids'.

At first experiments it was clear that MapML itself, and the reference implementation polyfill, show several capabilities which manifest themselves when one goes beyond the simplest OSM tiling examples.

Three examples of this: 

* the map-extent element (and the possibility of existing several for each layer);
* the combining of “projection” attribute and of “units” attribute;
* the OSMTILES, CBTILES and other keywords for “projection” or “units”.

The necessity to go through several examples to fully grasp MapML capabilities became very clear. 

Also became quite clear that it is not crucial to extend polyfill's functionality, since it is supposed that such functionality should be, sooner or later, transferred to browser's code bases.

So Rui Cavaco's final work was dedicated to JavaScript DOM manipulation using, one of MapML's most interesting features: the ability to, easily, add dynamic changes to web maps. In this case, a real world problem was addressed, the ability to add to and remove from, a web map, at user's request, some municipal-scale themes from Northern Portugal region.

To this purpose a webapp was built using MapML polyfill from https://github.com/Maps4HTML/Web-Map-Custom-Element[Maps4HTML] and https://panel.holoviz.org/[Holoviz Panel] Python web framework.
